# Mindscape 

By Luca DiGrigoli :D

A SwiftUI iOS app combining productivity, mood‐tracking, and task management:

- **Mindscapes**: A to-do list where you set repeateble daily goal and check off items with a fluid, animated progress bar. In the future, I aim to have several to-do list sects, 'mindscapes,' for you to cycle from. Maybe it'd be interesting to have this be a videogame-style quest board. Not too sure yet, this will be the main thing though so stay tuned!
- **Flow**: A circular Pomodoro-style timer (Go/Break cycles) with configurable durations, haptics, and notifications.  
- **Calendar**: A year-at-a-glance mood tracker—rate each day on a 7-point scale, mark one Best day and one Worst day per year.

## Requirements

- **iOS 16.1+** deployment target  (Realistically, none for now, working on publishing)

## Getting Started
- **hang out!** this isn't published just yet but it'll get there!

## Misc

- how does one put screenshots in a readme ;-;
- I will figure this out in a second, until then I'm a crazy person talking to myself in my own `.md` file.
